# Weather - App

A simple, responsive, web app in angular that shows the weather of some city. 
The user should be able to search for a city and save it to favorites (locally). 
The app contains 2 pages -weather page and favorites page.

The app shows the weather in Tel Aviv by default.

Favorites screen will be composed of a list of favorite locations. Each location have a name and current weather. Clicking on a favorite will navigate to the main screen showing the details of that location.


## API 
The API that i used for the app is "AccuWeather API". 
I used 3 endpoints: location autocomplete for the search field, get current weather and 5-day daily forecast.
